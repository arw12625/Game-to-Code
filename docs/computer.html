			<p>Well that's a silly question. It's just that thing over there isn't it?</p>
			<br />
			<p>Well... Yes and No... The computer monitor and desktop computer
			have become the quintessential idea of computer in modern times. Sadly there are many, many other things that have 
			computational abilities but are not viewed as or thought of as a computer. If I told you your toaster oven was a
			computer, you might call me crazy, but I'd be right. Nearly all of today's technology features a programmable aspect.
			For instance, a universal television remote can be programmed to emit a specific frequency when you press a specific 
			button. A washing machine must be programmed to perform certain cycles when the user desires it.</p>
			<br />
			<p>Well then how do you define what a computer is then?</p>
			<br />
			<p>In the simplest terms, a computer is a device that can be programmed to perform a set of logical operations.
			This means that anything that can be told what to do and do it is a computer. You and I, more specifically our brains,
			are just very, very complicated computers. I can tell you to fetch a ball, and you fetch it. Let's analyze these components.
			There is an instruction and a method of performing this instruction. This correlates to the two inherent components of 
			any computer, memory and processing. What would a computer be if it couldn't compute or if it didn't know what to compute!
			</p>
			<br />
			<p>How does these components work?</p>
			<br />
			<p>Well let's start our game to answer that question.</p>
