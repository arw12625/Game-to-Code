<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp In this exercise we will analyze the use how a computer
  processes commands. You are in charge of a farm and need to tell your robot how to 
  manage your crops. The robot can only understand simple commands or processes.
  The robot will execute tasks in the order it is given them. If you're having trouble,
  try imagining how you would tell a young child how to grow a plant. Click hide below
