			<p>Well that's a silly question. It's just that thing over there isn't it?</p>
			<br />
			<p>Well... Yes and No... The computer monitor and desktop computer
			have become the most widespread idea of a computer in modern times. Sadly there are many other computers whose
			computational abilities go unnoticed. You would have a hard time believing that your toaster oven had a computer.
			Nearly all of today's technology feature a programmable aspect. For instance, a universal television remote can
			be programmed to emit a specific frequency when you press a specific button. A washing machine must be programmed
			to perform certain cycles as the user desires it.</p>
			<br />
			<p>Well then how do you define what a computer is then?</p>
			<br />
			<p>In the simplest terms, a computer is a device that can be programmed to perform a set of logical operations.
			This means that anything that can take and carry out orders is a computer. You and I, more specifically our brains,
			are just extremely complicated and powerful computers. I can tell you to catch the ball when I throw it, and you will do it.
			Let's analyze the individual actions in this scenario. There is an instruction or command and the execution this instruction.
			This correlates to the two basic components of any computer, memory and processing. What would a computer be if it couldn't
			compute or if forgot what to compute!
			</p>
			<br />
			<p>How do these components work?</p>
			<br />
			<p>Well let's start our game to answer that question.</p>
