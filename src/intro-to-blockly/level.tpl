Introduction to Blockly
{==}

{= L_DESC =}
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this level, you will place several blocks together to get a feel for how Blockly works.  One section will require you to place several blocks in order ("first", "second", "third") while another has you do a simple If Then Else statement.  On the left is an example of how your code should look.</p>
